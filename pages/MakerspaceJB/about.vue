                <p>MakerspaceJB is Johor Bahru's very own Makerspace</p>
                <p>There are hundreds of such <a href="" class="text-blue-400">hackerspaces</a> around the world, where people with common interests in computers, technology, , science, digital and electronic art, come together to meet, socialise and collaborate.</p>
                <p>Built by and for geeks, nerds, inventors, engineers, and entrepreneurs, MakerspaceJB is the Johorean hacker community's home, living room and laboratory. Come hang out with the community in the evenings. Co-work with us during the day. We also host regular events, meetups, presentations, workshops, and movie nights for the local community.</p>
                <p>MakerspaceJB was JB's first co-working space. Since we launched, many more have appeared - see <a href="" class="text-blue-400">list of co-working spaces in Johor</a>.</p>
